# Reddit depression classifier
A machine learning classifier for depression in reddit post authors.

## Overview
This project was made to create a classifier that predicts if the author of a reddit post has or not has depression. It is important to consider that this is not a replacement for mental counceling and if you or some family member could have some symptoms of depression it is important to be attended by a professional. 
Through NLP techniques, the model classify reddit posts into two classifications: 'depression' and 'not depression'. 

### The data
The datased used in the training of this project was obtained from a kaggle dataset. It may be found in the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/depression-reddit-cleaned](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/depression-reddit-cleaned)

### The project

The project consists of the following secctions:

* Data analysis
* Feature engineering
* Text pre-processing
* Text embedding
* ML algorythm selection
* Grid search
* Model selection

## The results
The best model was a logistic regression who reached 95% accuracy in the testing phase.
